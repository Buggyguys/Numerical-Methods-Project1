# tkinter is not installable via pip. It comes with Python, but may need to be installed separately on some systems:
# - On Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
# - On Fedora/RHEL: sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
# - On macOS: Install Python with Homebrew (brew install python) which includes tkinter, or use Python.org installers
# - On Windows: Tkinter is included with standard Python installers
